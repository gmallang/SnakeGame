# Snake Game

This is a simple **Snake Game** implemented in Python using the `turtle` graphics library. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food that appears on the screen while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself. The score increases each time the snake eats the food.

## Features
- **Snake Movement**: Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
- **Food**: The snake grows in length each time it eats food.
- **Score**: The score increases as the snake eats food. It is displayed at the top of the screen.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself. Afterward, the score resets, and the snake's position is reset to the center.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `turtle` graphics library (which is built-in with Python, no installation required)

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: When you run the `main.py` file, the game will open in a new window.
2. **Controls**:
    - Use the **Up** arrow key to move the snake up.
    - Use the **Down** arrow key to move the snake down.
    - Use the **Left** arrow key to move the snake left.
    - Use the **Right** arrow key to move the snake right.
3. **Objective**: The goal is to eat as many pieces of food as possible without hitting the walls or the snake's body.
4. **Game Over**: If the snake hits the wall or itself, the game ends and the score resets.
5. **Restart**: After a game over, the snake automatically resets to the center of the screen, and the game begins again.
